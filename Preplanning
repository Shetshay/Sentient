we will make an if statement for 3 static questions. depending on which one the user chooses we will have them get a certain ending.

1. AI dies
2. AI "ascends" uploading to cloud
3. AI falls in love with you (based on the decisions youve made.) 

after each decision is chosen the user will get personality points without them knowing of course, but they will be shown to the user at the end. 

Whichever trait is the most positive trait will dictate to the AI and tell the user  why they love you.
