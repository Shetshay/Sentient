# Sentient

The purpose of this was to create a game using an old typewriter effect to simulate someone is talking to you, in this case an AI. So far the story is not fully developed as I am trying to convert gifs to ascii values and I currently do not know how to do that. The main idea however has been accomplished, it's playable not very long *at all* but a cool animation.
