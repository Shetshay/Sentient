# Sentient

The purpose of this was to create a game using an old typewriter effect animation with C++ to simulate someone is talking to you, in this case an AI. So far the story is not fully developed as I am trying to convert gifs to ascii values and I currently do not know how to do that. The main idea however has been accomplished, it's playable, but not very long *at all*. The initial concept was very ambitious but I don't think it would be the best idea to create this in only C++ it has gotten very complicated. Nonetheless a cool animation.

**Works with linux, to make it work with windows use the <windows.h> library and modify the code accordingly.**
